File descriptions:
lab3a.c: a C source file that compiles to analyze an image of a file system. The program outputs csv-format lines summarizing the following information: superblock, group, free blocks, free inodes, allocated inodes, directories, indirect blocks. 
ext2_fs.h: a header file that defines the format of the EXT2 file system.
Makefile: the file that builds everything. The Makefile includes a default target that builds the lab3a program, a dist target that generates the submission file, and a clean target that cleans up. 
README: this file, an introduction of our lab 3A submission.

References:
We mainly referred to Linux man pages for the APIs used in the assignment. In addition, we made extensive uses of the provided header file that defined a number of structures.
